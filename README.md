# Apartment-management

We observed a growing need for efficient and modern solutions to manage apartment complexes, as the real estate industry continues to expand. Secondly, we wanted to work on a project that has real-world applications and could potentially benefit a wide range of users, including property managers, tenants, and homeowners' associations. Additionally, the complexity and variety of tasks involved in apartment management presented an exciting challenge that aligned well with our interests and skills.

The project is a web application designed to streamline and enhance the management of apartment complexes. Its primary objective is to provide a comprehensive platform that covers various aspects of apartment management, including tenant management, maintenance, billing and rent collection etc.
